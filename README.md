Spotify Clone with Deezer API.
This project is a Spotify clone built using the Deezer API provided by RapidAPI. It was developed as part of our Build Week during our time at EPICODE. The project was created by a team of developers who collaborated to bring a music streaming app experience similar to Spotify using real-time data from Deezer.

Features:
-Search for artists, albums, and tracks
-View detailed information about music tracks (like duration, release year, etc.)
-Listen to previews of tracks
-Responsive layout to ensure usability across devices

Technologies Used:
-HTML/CSS/bootstrap for the structure and styling
-JavaScript for the front-end functionality
-Deezer API (accessed via RapidAPI) for fetching music data

This project was built collaboratively by the team during the Build Week at EPICODE.
